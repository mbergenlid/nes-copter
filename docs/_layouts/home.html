As a pet project during the first half of 2017, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/mbergenlid/rustiness">NES emulator in Rust</a>.
The emulator is nothing fancy really, it only supports the very basic NES operations but it plays a few games like Donkey Kong, Ice Climber and Ice Hockey.
The purpose of this project was mainly to learn Rust for which I needed to write something and emulators are cool, so why not?
However, deep diving into NES internals spiked my interest for writing a game for the NES which I'm going to do now and I also intend to document the process here.

The game I'm going to create is a version of an old flash game I know as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWns11JTUe0">Copter</a>. Some people might know it better as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQoJZuBwrkU">Flappy Bird</a> but it's basically the same thing.

Let's get started!
